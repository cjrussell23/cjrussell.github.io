            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            <p>Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the <span class="jobTitle">[position]</span> position at <span
                    class="companyName">[Company Name]</span>. I have reviewed the position's
                requirements and I am certain that I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job adeptly and
                perform above expectations. With a B.Sc in Computer Science and an eagerness to work hard and learn, I
                believe I will be a strong addition to your team.</p>
            <p>I am a recent graduate (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, 4.2 Major GPA) from the University of
                Winnipeg. Throughout my academic career, I was consistently praised as a diligent and detail-oriented
                individual by my professors and peers. While working on academic and extracurricular projects, I
                developed
                proven critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, which I hope to leverage in the <span
                    class="jobTitle">[position]</span>position at <span class="companyName">[Company Name]</span>.</p>
            <p>I am a lifelong learner; I love to learn and use new and emerging technologies. I am always working on
                projects in my free time. My current project is my personal website. One goal with the website was to
                build
                and host a site for free. I accomplished this by researching and learning new tools such as Github Pages
                and
                Bootstrap. I believe that I can use the skills and knowledge acquired through these projects at <span
                    class="companyName">[Company Name]</span>.</p>
            <p>After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive
                candidate
                you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills and abilities will benefit
                your
                organization. Please contact me at <span class="applicantPhone">[phone]</span> or via email at <span
                    class="applicantEmail">[email]</span> to arrange for a
                convenient meeting time.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <span class="applicantName">[Applicant Name]</span>
